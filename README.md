# Machine Learning Track

- Here I have tried to keep the notes and must know topics to log the journey of my transition to Data Science & Machine Learning from DevOps engineer working.
- Few concepts will be hard to grasp at first but seeing it twice and revisiting weekly will make it easy to work with.

Hope this helps you in the same way it worked for me..!
