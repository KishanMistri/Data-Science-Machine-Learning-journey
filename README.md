# Machine Learning Track

- We all know that there are ton of good material all over the internet.
- Frankly, its exhausing to put few hours in something and come out of it finding it didn't helped you progressed as it was bad or you are at a higher/good level. 
- Here I have tried to keep the notes and must know topics to log the journey of my transition to Data Science & Machine Learning from DevOps engineer working.
- Few concepts will be hard to grasp at first but seeing it twice and revisiting weekly will make it easy to work with.

I haven't gone thorugh all of it yet but I am making steady progress which is more important.

Hope this helps you in the same way it helped me..!

If you came and did all things listed here, I am a fan of you. But there is always a room of improvement. I am keeping extra reading section to put advance things as well. Feel free to suggest me few new things and make this repo mind blowing..!
