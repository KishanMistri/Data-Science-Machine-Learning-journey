#### 1. What is the optimization equation of GBDT ?
    - Answer
    
#### 2. Write the formulation of hinge loss ?
    - Hinge loss is written as 
      ```
      max(0, 1-Zi) ⇒ Type of Slack Variable
      Where Zi = Yi * (W^TXi + b) Yi => {1,-1}
      ```
    - For Correctly Classify point:   Zi > 1   → 1- Zi <0 so Hinge Loss = 0
    - For Incorrectly Classify point: Zi < 1   → 1- Zi >0 so Hinge Loss = 1-Zi which will penalize
