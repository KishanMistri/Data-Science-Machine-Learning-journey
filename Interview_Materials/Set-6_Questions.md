#### 48. What is box cox transform? When can it be used ?
    - The Box-Cox transformation is a generalized “power transformation” that transforms data to make
    the distribution more normal.
    - For example, when its lambda parameter is 0, it’s equivalent to the log-transformation.
    - It’s used to stabilize the variance (eliminate heteroskedasticity) and normalize the distribution.
