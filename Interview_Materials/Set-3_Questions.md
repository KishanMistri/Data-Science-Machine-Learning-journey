#### 28. What is overfitting and underfitting ? 
    - When your model gives near perfect results for all the training set but performs worst on test/unseen data then 
    we can say the model is overfitted to training set where it resembles training data set and was unable to identify 
    generalization for the data. Low bias & High variance is a signal to identify.
    
    - When your model does not provide accuracy neither on training nor on test dataset, it can be said that the given 
    model is simple. It doesn't learned anything and made very basic assumption for the data. Here it will be bias to one class.

#### 37. How do you get probabilities for RF classifier outputs. 
    - Answer
    
#### 38. Is the Calibration classifier required to get probability values for logistic regression.? 
    - No, logistic regression gets the probabilty of the point being part of class. So applying calibration classifier is unnecessary.
    In general, model which doesn't provide probabilty for classification, you should apply calibration class as it will impact the 0.51 vs 0.99 probabiliry of the class and improve model in general for classification.
