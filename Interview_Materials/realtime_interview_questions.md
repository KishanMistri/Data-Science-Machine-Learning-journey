## Clustering Questions:

##### 1: What is the optimization equation for KMeans?
![KMeans Optimization Equation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20341930/172017158-53128bdc-73fa-4074-8ab5-67f19e062c26.png)

###### 1.2: Can we apply SDG on KMeans? Why?
     - No, not directly as KMeans is having set operations and for an SGD optimization problem, 
     we need differentiable term/function.
   
###### 1.1: Can you modify KMeans optimization, such that we can apply SGD?
     - Yes ...
   
##### 2: Ways to cluster 1 Billion points within constrains like dimension=20, Time taken= 30 Mins?
     - Way-1: Mini Batch KMeans
     - Way-2:Sample Sufficiently Large
