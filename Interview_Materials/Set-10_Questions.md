#### 1. List the most popular distribution curves along with scenarios where you will use them in an algorithm.
    - The most popular distribution curves are as follows- Bernoulli Distribution, Uniform Distribution, Binomial Distribution, 
    Normal Distribution, Poisson Distribution, and Exponential Distribution.
    - Each of these distribution curves is used in various scenarios.

    - Bernoulli Distribution can be used to check if 
      - a team will win a championship or not, 
      - a newborn child is either male or female, 
      - you either pass an exam or not, etc.

    - Uniform distribution is a probability distribution that has a constant probability. 
      - Rolling a single dice is one example because it has a fixed number of outcomes.

    - Binomial distribution is a probability with only two possible outcomes, the prefix ‘bi’ means two or twice. 
      - An example of this would be a coin toss. The outcome will either be heads or tails.

    - Normal distribution describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is typically a symmetric distribution where 
    most of the observations cluster around the central peak. The values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions. 
      - An example would be the height of students in a classroom.

    - Poisson distribution helps predict the probability of certain events happening when you know how often that event has occurred. 
      - It can be used by businessmen to make forecasts about the number of customers on certain days and allows them to 
      adjust supply according to the demand.

    - Exponential distribution is concerned with the amount of time until a specific event occurs. 
      - For example, how long a car battery would last, in months.
    
#### 2. What is OOB error and how does it occur? 
    - For each bootstrap sample, there is one-third of data that was not used in the creation of the tree, i.e., it was out 
    of the sample. This data is referred to as out of bag data. 
    - In order to get an unbiased measure of the accuracy of the model over test data, out of bag error is used. 
    - The out of bag data is passed for each tree is passed through that tree and the outputs are aggregated to give out of bag error. 
    - This percentage error is quite effective in estimating the error in the testing set and does not require further cross-validation.
