#### 1. What does trainable = true/false mean in embedding layer ?
    - Trainable=True means we train the weights by update equation.
    - Trainable=False freezes the weights without training.
    
#### 2. What happens when we set return sequence = true in LSTM ?
    - It tells whether to return last state of output or not.
    
#### 3. Why are RNN‚ÄôS and CNN‚ÄôS called weight shareable layers ?
    - A convolutional neural network learns certain features in images that are useful for classifying 
    the image. Sharing parameters gives the network the ability to look for a given feature everywhere 
    in the image, rather than in just a certain area. This is extremely useful when the object of interest
    could be anywhere in the image.
    - Relaxing the parameter sharing allows the network to look for a given feature only in a specific area. 
    For example, if your training data is of faces that are centered, you could end up with a network that 
    looks for eyes, nose, and mouth in the center of the image, a curve towards the top, and shoulders towards 
    the bottom.
    - It is uncommon to have training data where useful features will usually always be in the same area, so 
    this is not seen often.
    
#### 4. What happens during the fit and transform of following modules ?
```
    1. Standard scaler
    2. Count vectorizer
    3. PCA
```
    - Fit used to learn the vocabulary and creates a dictionary with key as word and Its words count in the documents as value.
    - Transform converts the given data to the representations that were learnt during training.
    - Fit-transform does the two steps on the same data simultaneously.
    
#### 5. Can we use t-sne for transforming test data ? if not why ?
    - The main reason that t-SNE is not used in classification models is that it does not learn a function from
    the original space to the new (lower) dimensional one. As such, when we would try to use our classifier on 
    new / unseen data we will not be able to map / pre- process these new data according to the previous t-SNE results.
    - t-SNE tries to find new distribution of data in lower space such that both the distributions are very similar. 
    - This is achieved by KL divergence.
    
#### 6. Find the sum of diagonals in the numpy array ?
    ``` 
    numpy.trace(array)
    ```
    
#### 7. Write the code to get the count of row for each category in the dataframes.
    ```
    df.groupby(columnname)[columnname].nunique()
    ```
    
#### 8. Difference between categorical cross entropy and binary cross entropy.
    - Categorical cross entropy is used for multi-class classification 
    - Whereas binary cross Entropy is used for two class classification.
    
#### 9. When you use w2v for test factorization, and we each sentence is having different words how can you forward data into models ?

#### 11. How to you use weighted distance in content based recommendation ?
    - https://www.ra.ethz.ch/cdstore/www2008/www2008.org/papers/xhtml/pp049/www2008-sample/index.html
    
#### 12. What is the time complexity of SVD decomposition ?
    - O(mn min(n, m))
    
#### 13. What is the difference between content based recommendation and collaborative recommendation ?
    - Content based RF users metadata and item metadata to get user and item vectors to compute similarities.
    - In collaborative filtering, we try to find user and items matrix using SVD
    
#### 14. Why do you think inertia actually works in choosing elbow point in clustering ?
    - Inertia: It is the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center.
    - If the use elbow method the inertia will abruptly change for the points out of cluster.
    
#### 15. What is gradient clipping ?
    - In training a neural network sometimes we may experience exploding gradients beacause of large weights that 
    exponentially increasing, to avoid this exploding gradient problem we use gradient clipping which limits the
    weight values with increasing.
    
#### 16. Which of these layers will be a better option as a last layer in multilabel classification ?
```
    1. Sigmoid
    2. Softmax  
```
    - Sigmoid because a point may have any number of classes.
    - In softmax we only get one class that have the max probability.
    
#### 17. Is there a relation or similarity between LSTM and RESNET ?
    - Yes, In LSTM we use forgot gate which enables the to control the amount of data to be forwarded. 
    - Similarly in RESNET we use residual connections which makes the data to flow from the residual connection 
    when weights are not useful.
    
#### 18. What are the values returned by np.histogram()
    - It takes a numpy nd array as input, it flattens the array and return histogram values which can be plotted
    to see the histogram of data.
    
#### 19. What is PDF, can we calculate PDF for discrete distribution ?
    - Yes
    
#### 20. Can the range of CDF be (0.5 - 1.5 ).
    - No max value of a cdf is 1. As it works on percentile of data.
    
#### 21. Number of parameters in the following network :
```
    1. Number of neurons = 4
    2. Problem = binary classification
    3. no: of FC = 2
    4. Neurons in 1st FC = 5
    5. Neurons in 2nd FC = 3
```
    - 54
    
#### 22. How do we interpret alpha in dual form of sum? What is the relation between C and Alpha?

#### 24. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised models?

    - The probability of outlier in sampled data will be reduces. We will remove the outlier by Computing the loss with point. 
    - We remove the points which have high loss value from The original data 
    - And repeat the same process until the convergence.

    - the Pearson coefficient works with a linear relationship between the two variables whereas
    - the Spearman Coefficient works with monotonic relationships as well.
    
#### 36. What is the train time complexity of DBSCAN?
    - The different complexities of the algorithm are(N= no of data points) as follows:

    - Best Case: If we use a spatial indexing system to store the dataset like kd-tree or r-tree such that 
    neighbourhood queries are executed in logarithmic time, then we get O(N log N) runtime complexity.

    - Worst Case: Without the use of index structure or on degenerated data the worst-case run time complexity remains O(N2).

    - Average Case: It is the same as the best/worst case depending on data and implementation of the algorithm
    
#### 37. Explain the procedure of ‚Äúprediction in hierarchical clustering‚Äù
    - Initially, each data point is considered as an individual cluster in this technique. After each iteration, 
    the similar clusters merge with other clusters and the merging will stop until one cluster or K clusters are formed.

    - The steps of the agglomerative algorithm are as follows:
        1- Compute the proximity matrix.
        2- Let each data point be a cluster.
        3- Repeat this step: Combine the two closest clusters and accordingly update the proximity matrix.
        4- Until only a single cluster remains.
    
#### 38. Relation between knn and kernel SVM
    - In KNN we use similarities of points based on distances similarly we use similarities Computed by kernel
    in kernel SVM.
    - In RBF kernel œÉ is equivalent to K in KNN, i.e., as œÉ increases we consider points with distances of increased 
    range similarly in KNN if K is increases, we take more points having more distance ranges.

#### 40. What is the optimal value of minpoints for the data (1000, 50)
    - MinPoint is Hyper Parameter for Clustering algorithm DBSCAN.
    - # pts in eps radius around point
    - Rule of thumb: Choosing Minpts ‚â• Dim + 1
        - Typically: MinPts == 2* Dim
    - Logically If the Data is Noisy then Keep MinPts high.
    - So the Answer if 2 * 50 = 100

    print("Before Delete\n",df)
    # Deleted first row
    df.drop([0],inplace=True)
    print("\n\nAfter Delete\n",df)

#### 47. Differentiate between Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement learning with their algorithm example.
    - Supervised: When there is X => Y Mapping
    - Unsupervised: When there is only X and grouping them based on similarity
    - Reinforcement: When There is action and we want to make algorithm to do specific task but put reward on executing it
                     and giving punishment when not doing it (right)
    
#### 48. How would you deal with feature of 4 categories and 20% null values?
    - [In General, you need to find why they are missing in the first place and based on that you have to choose the approach.]
    - Encoding Categorical features
    - There are 2 primary ways of handling missing values:
        Deleting the Missing values
        Imputing the Missing Values (Mode)
